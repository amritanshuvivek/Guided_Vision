# **Guided Vision**

## **Overview**

**Guided Vision** is an AI-powered object detection application designed to assist visually impaired individuals by identifying and vocalizing objects in real time. Utilizing the YOLOv5 model and OpenCV for video processing, this project enhances independence and safety for users through technology.

## **Features**

- Real-time object detection using YOLOv5
- Voice feedback for detected objects via text-to-speech
- User-friendly interface for seamless interaction
- Built with Python and essential libraries for computer vision

## **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: YOLOv5 (object detection), OpenCV (video processing)
- **Libraries**: PyTorch (model loading and inference), pyttsx3 (text-to-speech)
- **Development Tools**: Visual Studio Code, Git (version control)
